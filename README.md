## Problems Are:
1. You're given a string of words. You need to find the word "Nemo", and return a string like this: "I found Nemo at [the order of the word you find nemo]!". 

  If you can't find Nemo, return "I can't find Nemo :(". 

  Examples
  FindNemo("I am finding Nemo !") ➞ "I found Nemo at 4!"
  
  FindNemo("Nemo is me") ➞ "I found Nemo at 1!"
  
  FindNemo("I Nemo am") ➞ "I found Nemo at 2!"

2. Given that when you have an array with the value: 61,20,10,77,30 when the value is an even no, console "Even no" else it is an odd no
